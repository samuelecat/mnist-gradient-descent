# mnist-gradient-descent

Neural Network Gradient descent experiment to classify MNIST digits.

All Neural Network code here is written in Java from scratch to facilitate experimentation like for example new minimizers or loss functions.
It is also easier to benchmarks any portions of the code.

In this Maven project I have chosen JUnit 5.6 for unit tests.
